Notes for DevelopersCSS Warnings: You may see a warning in VS Code saying "Unknown at rule @tailwind". This is normal and can be ignored; the app will still compile correctly.Mock Data: This prototype uses static mock data arrays (GAMES, PROPS, EDGE_FINDER) defined at the top of App.jsx. No backend connection is required.
